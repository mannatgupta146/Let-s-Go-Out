# Let's Go Out

A fun and interactive webpage that playfully asks users if they want to go out, complete with colorful animations, responsive buttons, and a celebratory confetti effect for added enjoyment!

## Project Structure

This project is divided into three main files:

- **index.html** - The main HTML file that structures the content and layout of the webpage.
- **style.css** - The CSS file that provides styling, animations, and background effects.
- **script.js** - The JavaScript file that handles button interactions and generates confetti when the "YES" button is clicked.

## Features

- **Gradient Background Animation**: A vibrant color transition across a gradient background, creating an inviting atmosphere.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Two playful buttons, "YES" and "NO," with unique interactions:
    - Clicking **"YES"** triggers a confetti effect and displays a joyful message.
    - Clicking **"NO"** enlarges the "YES" button, inviting the user to reconsider.
- **Confetti Animation**: A fun confetti effect fills the screen when the user clicks "YES," adding a celebratory touch.
